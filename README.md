# kafka-flink-example

This project consists of two parts. 

Part 1 - Kafka topic generator with sample e-commerce orders. To get started with it clone the repository and build the project with gradle. Override settings in AppProperties.java to match your local settings.

Part 2 - Scripts for Flink applications to create filters on the queue containing those orders and sink them to 2 other queues.
